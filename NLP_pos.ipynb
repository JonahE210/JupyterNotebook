    "abraham_bio = \"abraham lincoln (1809–1865) was the 16th president of the united states, widely regarded as one of the nation’s greatest leaders for guiding america through the civil war and working to end slavery. born on february 12, 1809, in a one-room log cabin in hardin county, kentucky, lincoln grew up in poverty with little formal education but developed a passion for reading and self-learning. after moving to illinois in 1830, he worked various jobs, served in the illinois militia during the black hawk war, and entered politics in 1834 as a whig, later becoming a lawyer. his debates with stephen a. douglas in 1858 brought him national recognition for his opposition to the spread of slavery. elected president in 1860 as a republican, his victory prompted southern states to secede, leading to the outbreak of the civil war in 1861. lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in 1863, reframing the war as a fight for both union and freedom, and delivered the gettysburg address that same year, emphasizing equality and democracy. he pushed for the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and sought national reconciliation after the union’s victory. just days after the confederacy’s surrender in april 1865, lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth at ford’s theatre in washington, d.c. his legacy endures as a symbol of integrity, perseverance, and moral courage, remembered for preserving the union and advancing human liberty.\"\n",
